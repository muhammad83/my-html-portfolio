    <h2>I'm a Web developer in making!</h2>
    <p>
      I am learning to do web development. I can't remember which attempt it is
      for me. I have tried a couple of times before I have give up every single
      time and I am not sure if I will do the same this time around or not
    </p>
    <p>
      I have found a resource on free code camp about how a guy who used to be a
      lawyer made his way to become a developer after 4 tries and became so good
      that he ended up getting all the 4 jobs he applied for. He also worked for
      google and is now working for blockchain company. In short he got so good
      he is considered as one of the best. This intriguied me and I started
      listening to his course which has been pusblished on the free code camp
      youtube channel
    </p>
    <p>
      He suggests doing it with the 4Ws and 1H. I still have not found a set
      which i am truly convinced on but I will give it a try. He also suggests
      we set shorter goals and goals which we are more likely to achive. This I
      am doing and this course is my attempt to follow that. For how and where.
      I have picked Angela's courses before too and every single time I have
      enjoyed it. The reason i dropped it was beacuse I got stuck somewhere and
      then lost motivation to power through it
